# bullet2-d
Static D bindings for Bullet Physics library.

The bindings are not finished, and I'm not currently planning to finish these.

I have only tested these in a Windows environment, and they most likely wont work on Unix due to manual mangling of few methods here and there.

# Usage
See the `helloworld.d` example for basic usage.
